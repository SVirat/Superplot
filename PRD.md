## 1. Product Overview

Outsite is a **private, self-hosted web application** for cataloging real estate properties and storing legal documentation securely via Google Drive. It is designed for an Indian household managing a portfolio of properties (flats, farms, villas, land) with an emphasis on tracking 15+ types of Indian legal/property documents per property.

**Target users**: A single family — one admin (property owner) and optionally invited family members with varying access levels (contributor or view-only).

**Key value proposition**: A single dashboard to see all properties, which legal documents have been collected for each, upload/store documents securely in the user's own Google Drive, and track documentation completeness.

## 3. User Roles & Permissions (RBAC)

The app uses a multi-account RBAC system. Each user has their own account by default. Users can be invited to other accounts as members with specific roles.

| Role | Description | View Properties | Upload Docs | Edit/Delete Properties | Manage Members |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `admin` | Account owner | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `family_contributor` | Family member with upload rights | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| `family_view` | Family member, read-only | Yes | No | No | No |
| `non_family_view` | External viewer, read-only | Yes | No | No | No |

**Role labels for display**:
- admin → "Admin"
- family_contributor → "Family — Contributor"
- family_view → "Family — View Only"
- non_family_view → "Non-Family — View Only"

### 3.1 Multi-Account Support
- Users can belong to multiple accounts (their own + others they've been invited to)
- An **account switcher** in the sidebar lets users switch between accounts
- The active account ID is sent via `X-Account-Id` header on every API request
- The server resolves the effective role based on the `account_members` table

---

## 4. Authentication

### 4.1 Sign-In
- **Single sign-in method**: Google OAuth only
- Supabase Auth handles the OAuth flow using **PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- OAuth scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
- OAuth parameters: `access_type: offline`, `prompt: consent` (to get refresh token)
- Sign-in page: app branding ("Outsite") + "Continue with Google" button

### 4.2 Auth Callback
- After Google OAuth redirect, the app exchanges the code for a session
- The `provider_token` (Google access token) and `provider_refresh_token` are persisted to `user_profiles` via `POST /api/auth/tokens`
- A `user_profiles` row is auto-created on signup via a database trigger

### 4.3 Session Management
- `auth` middleware on every API route validates the JWT via `sb.auth.getUser(token)`
- Resolves active account and effective role from `account_members` table
- Auto-links pending invitations: matches `account_members.email` to the logged-in user's email

### 4.4 Sign-Out
- Signs out via Supabase client, redirects to `/sign-in`

## 7. Google Drive Integration

### 7.1 Folder Structure
```
My Drive/
  └── PropertyVault/          ← root folder (configurable via GDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_NAME)
      ├── Hyderabad Flat/     ← one folder per property (using property name)
      │   ├── sale_deed.pdf
      │   ├── tax_receipt.pdf
      │   └── photo1.jpg
      └── Ancestral Farm/
          └── pahani.pdf
```

### 7.2 Upload Flow
1. Get access token for the account owner (refreshes expired tokens automatically)
2. Get-or-create root folder ("PropertyVault")
3. Get-or-create property subfolder (using property name)
4. Upload file via multipart upload
5. Store `g_drive_file_id` and `view_url` on the document row
6. Store `g_drive_folder_id` on the property row (if not already set)

### 7.3 Upload UX
- **XHR-based upload** with real-time progress tracking
- **Multi-stage progress indicator**: Preparing → Sending file (with %) → Uploading to Google Drive → Saving to database → Complete
- **Drag-and-drop** file selection with visual feedback
- For photos: multi-file picker + folder picker for bulk upload
- Sequential upload with "Uploading 2 of 5..." counter

### 7.4 File Deletion
- Deleting a document from the app **also deletes the file from Google Drive** (permanent deletion, not trashed)
- The server fetches the `g_drive_file_id` from the DB and issues a Drive API delete before removing the DB row

### 7.5 Folder Sync on Rename
- When a property name is edited, the corresponding Google Drive folder is **renamed** to match
- If no Drive folder exists yet, a new one is **created** under the root folder
- This operation runs asynchronously after the API response to avoid blocking the UI
- The `g_drive_folder_id` is updated in the DB

### 7.6 Property Deletion
- When a property is deleted, the entire Google Drive folder (and all files inside) is deleted
- Each individual document file is also explicitly deleted from Drive

### 7.7 File Access
- Files are always **appended** (never overwrite)
- The app only has access to files it creates (`drive.file` scope)
- View URLs: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/{fileId}/view`

---

## 8. Google Maps Integration

### 8.1 Coordinate Extraction
- When a Google Maps URL is provided for a property, the server automatically **extracts latitude/longitude**
- Supports shortened URLs (`maps.app.goo.gl/...`) by following the redirect to get the full URL
- Parses `@lat,lng` from the resolved URL
- Runs on property creation, update, and as a **backfill on server startup** for properties with URLs but no coordinates

### 8.2 Map Previews (MapPreview Component)
Used on both property cards (dashboard/properties page) and the property detail page.

**Priority order**:
1. **Street View photo**: If `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set and Street View imagery exists at the coordinates → shows a Street View Static API image
2. **Google Maps embed**: If no Street View coverage → shows a Google Maps satellite embed iframe
3. **MapPin icon**: If no coordinates available → shows a placeholder icon

**Street View check**: Uses the `/metadata` endpoint to verify coverage before rendering the image.

## 9. Pages & Navigation

### 9.1 App Shell
- **Sidebar** (desktop, left side): Navigation items + account switcher + Settings pinned to bottom
- **Mobile Nav**: Hamburger menu with same items
- **Header** (top bar): User avatar dropdown with name/email/sign-out
- **Main content area**: Scrollable, padded

### 9.2 Navigation Items
| Icon | Label | Route | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| LayoutDashboard | Dashboard | `/` | |
| Building2 | Properties | `/properties` | |

| Settings | Settings | `/settings` | Pinned to sidebar bottom |

### 9.3 Account Switcher
- Shown in sidebar when user belongs to multiple accounts
- Dropdown with account names and roles
- Switching accounts updates localStorage and re-fetches user data

### 9.4 URL Slugification
- Property detail URLs use **name-based slugs** instead of UUIDs
- e.g., `/properties/hyderabad-flat` instead of `/properties/2f9dae7d-...`
- `slugify()` converts names to lowercase, replaces non-alphanumeric chars with hyphens
- Server resolves both UUIDs and slugs via `resolveProperty()`

  - Invite form: email input + role select + "Send Invite" button
  - People with access: Owner row (non-removable) + member rows with role select + remove button
  - Invitation emails sent via Resend

---

## 12. Subscription & Billing

### 12.1 Tiers
| | Free | Premium |
|---|---|---|
| Properties | Up to 3 | Unlimited |
| Member invites | Up to 1 | Unlimited |
| AI features (future) | No | Yes |
| Price | ₹0 | ₹99/mo or ₹999/yr |

### 12.2 Enforcement
- `POST /api/properties` checks property count for free users; returns 403 with `LIMIT_REACHED` if ≥3
- `POST /api/members` checks member count for free users; returns 403 with `LIMIT_REACHED` if ≥1
- `getUserPlan()` helper checks `subscriptions` table + backdoor email list

### 12.3 Razorpay Integration
- **Subscription creation**: Frontend calls `POST /api/subscription/create` with plan ID → server creates subscription via Razorpay API → returns `subscriptionId` for Razorpay Checkout
- **Payment flow**: Razorpay Checkout opens in-page → user pays → Razorpay sends webhook
- **Webhook handler**: `POST /api/webhooks/razorpay` verifies HMAC signature → upserts subscription row on `subscription.activated`/`subscription.charged` → marks cancelled/expired on `subscription.cancelled`/`subscription.expired`
- **Subscription cancellation**: `POST /api/subscription/cancel` cancels the active Razorpay subscription via API and marks the local record as `cancelled`. For backdoor email users, this is a no-op (returns success without calling Razorpay).

### 12.4 Upgrade UI
- `UpgradeBanner` component shown on Dashboard for free-tier admin users
- Monthly/Annual toggle with price display
- "Upgrade Now" button opens Razorpay Checkout inline
- Hidden for premium users, backdoor emails, and non-admin members

### 12.5 Pro Badge & Cancel Subscription
- **Pro badge**: An orange gradient "PRO" tag displayed next to the user's name in the Header dropdown for all premium users (paid + backdoor)
- **Cancel Subscription**: A "Cancel Subscription" button appears in the Header dropdown for premium admin users. Shows a confirmation dialog before cancelling. For backdoor users the backend no-ops; for paid users it cancels via Razorpay API and refreshes the user context to update UI state.

---

## 13. Email Invitations

- When an admin adds a member, an **invitation email** is sent via Resend
- Email includes: inviter's name, the app URL, and instructions to sign in with Google
- On first login, pending invitations are **auto-linked** by matching the member's email
- Requires a verified custom domain on Resend for arbitrary recipient addresses (free tier only sends to account owner's email)

# PropertyVault — Product Requirements Document

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: April 18, 2026
**Public URL**: outsite.vercel.app
**Repository**: github.com/SVirat/Outsite

---

## 1. Product Overview

PropertyVault is a **private, self-hosted web application** for cataloging real estate properties and storing legal documentation securely via Google Drive. It is designed for an Indian household managing a portfolio of properties (flats, farms, villas, land) with an emphasis on tracking 15+ types of Indian legal/property documents per property.

**Target users**: A single family — one admin (property owner) and optionally invited family members with view-only or contributor access.

**Key value proposition**: A single dashboard to see all properties, which legal documents have been collected for each, upload/store documents securely in the user's own Google Drive, and track documentation completeness.

---

## 2. Tech Stack (Previous → New)

| Layer | Previous (v1) | Notes for Rebuild |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Framework | Next.js 15.3.1 + TypeScript | User wants NO TypeScript, NO Next.js |
| UI | React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Shadcn/UI (Radix) | — |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (Google OAuth) | — |
| Database | Supabase Postgres with RLS | — |
| File Storage | Google Drive API (user's own Drive) | — |
| Hosting | Vercel | — |
| Icons | lucide-react | — |
| Fonts | Inter (Google Fonts) | — |
| Theme | Dark mode default, oklch color space | — |

## 3. User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Description | Can View | Can Upload | Can Edit/Delete | Can Manage Users |
|------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| `admin` | Property owner | All properties | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `family_contributor` | Family member with upload rights | All properties | Yes | No | No |
| `family_view` | Family member with read-only access | All properties | No | No | No |

**Role labels for display**:
- admin → "Admin (Owner)"
- family_view → "Family — View Only"
- family_contributor → "Family — Contributor"

---

## 4. Authentication

### 4.1 Sign-In
- **Single sign-in method**: Google OAuth only
- Supabase Auth handles the OAuth flow
- OAuth scopes requested: `openid`, `email`, `profile`, **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`** (for Google Drive access to app-created files only)
- OAuth parameters: `access_type: offline`, `prompt: consent` (to get refresh token)
- Sign-in page shows app branding ("PropertyVault") + description + single "Continue with Google" button with Google logo

### 4.2 Auth Callback
- After Google OAuth redirect, the app exchanges the code for a session
- The `provider_token` (Google access token) and `provider_refresh_token` (Google refresh token) are persisted to the `user_profiles` table for later Google Drive API usage
- A `user_profiles` row is auto-created on signup via a database trigger (pulls `full_name`, `email`, `avatar_url` from Google metadata, defaults role to `admin`)

### 4.3 Session Management
- Middleware runs on every non-static route to refresh the Supabase session (keeps auth cookies alive)
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/sign-in` on any protected page

### 4.4 Sign-Out
- Signs out via Supabase client, redirects to `/sign-in`, refreshes router

## 7. Google Drive Integration

### 7.1 Folder Structure
```
My Drive/
  └── PropertyVault/          ← root folder (name configurable via GDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_NAME env var)
      ├── Hyderabad Flat/     ← one folder per property (using property name)
      │   ├── sale_deed.pdf
      │   ├── tax_receipt.pdf
      │   └── photo1.jpg
      ├── Ancestral Farm/
      │   └── pahani.pdf
      └── ...
```

### 7.2 Upload Flow

## 15. Known Limitations & Future Considerations

1. **Role assignment is hardcoded**: `getCurrentUser()` always returns `role: "admin"`. Real role assignment from `user_profiles.role` column is not yet implemented.
2. **No file deletion from Google Drive**: Deleting a document only removes the DB row. The file remains in the user's Google Drive.
3. **No image previews**: Photos show a placeholder icon, not actual thumbnails. Users must click "View in Drive" to see the image.
4. **Search uses ILIKE with wildcards**: Leading `%` wildcards prevent index usage. Could use Postgres full-text search or trigram indexes for better performance.
5. **No invitation flow**: The "Invite Family Member" feature only shows instructional text. There's no in-app invite mechanism.
6. **Single-owner model**: Properties are scoped to `owner_id`. Shared properties between family members would require a junction table.
7. **Google Drive folder names are based on property name**: Renaming a property does not rename the Drive folder.
